## Session Log

### 2026-04-15 — P01-01: Create directory structure
- Created all backend and frontend directories per canonical layout in `plan/00-index.md`
- Added `__init__.py` to every Python package directory (backend/app/, all subpackages, backend/tests/, all test subpackages)
- Added `.gitkeep` to directories with no real files yet
- Created `plan/fixtures/expected-dirs.txt` with the expected directory listing
- Test: `find backend frontend -type d | sort > /tmp/dirs.txt && diff /tmp/dirs.txt plan/fixtures/expected-dirs.txt` — **PASS**
- Also verified: `python -c "import backend.app"` succeeds from project root
